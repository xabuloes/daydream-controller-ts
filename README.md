# daydream-controller-ts
A standalone TypeScript module for interacting with Google Daydream Controller (via Bluetooth).

## General
This module is based on https://github.com/mrdoob/daydream-controller.js, a plain JS approach for using Daydream Controllers.

## Using the example
For using the example (showing the integration of the TS class), do the following within the repo directory:

```
cd ./example
npm install
./node_modules/.bin/tsc
```

Then simply open index.html in your browser. You can then connect your daydream controller via the "Connect Daydream Controller" button.
